# Lorem Ipsum
Improve your life and well-being by cutting down on the shit you read on news sites.
What you read goes into your brain, there is no way around it. The moment you read it, it's already in.
Unless you explicitly choose what you read and reduce it to a minimum.
That's where this Chrome extension comes in. It replaces all headings with standard text.
A simple mouse hover reveals the real text. This allows you to be selective and precise about what to read and what to ignore.
Let you decide what goes into your brain.

# How does it work?
This Chrome extension automatically replaces all headlines on selected news sources with "Lorem Ipsum"

# Blacklisted sites
The default blacklist includes:
20min.ch
blick.ch

In future the extension will allow a custom blacklist.
